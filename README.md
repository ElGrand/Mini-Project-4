Mini Project 4: Machine Learning for Predicting Diabetes
The objective of this mini project is to enable practice in data analysis, classification and prediction.
We have access to some diabetes data of real patients, donated by the N. Inst. of Diabetes & Diges. & Kidney
Dis. and published by Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/diabetes-data-set).
Your tasks are
- to explore the data and prepare it for machine learning operations
- to build and implement two machine learning models for classification of the diabetes health status
of a patient: Decision Tree and Na√Øve Bayes
- to apply appropriate methods and measures for assessing the validity of the models and recommend
the one with highest accuracy
- to create and deploy on the localhost an interactive Streamlit application, visualizing stages and
results of your work
- to test the models and the application with previously unknown input data and printout the
outcomes

Most accurate: Decision Tree on 0.797 (Proportion 7.5 : 2.5)

There is no Bayes algorithm in the Streamlit Web App, as I had difficulties with some error handlings. Therefore, there is only a Streamlit Web App with the Decision Tree.
